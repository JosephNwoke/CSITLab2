  <h1>Blueberry Donut</h1>
  <h2>Recipe by FussFreeCooking</h2>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1+1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tsps baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>125g (4 ounces) blueberries</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup olive oil plus extra for greasing the doughnut pan</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>100g dark chocolate for drizzling</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200C/392F. Lightly grease the 12 holes doughnut pan with some olive oil.</li>
    <li>Pass all-purpose flour, baking powder, and brown sugar through a sieve into a large mixing bowl to remove any lumps caused by the brown sugar. Add blueberries into the flour-brown sugar mixture, mix well, and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk egg, milk, olive oil, and vanilla extract with a fork until well combined. Then slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture while gently mixing the dry and wet ingredients together with a fork until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
    <li>Fill doughnut pan with the batter until 3/4 level. The batter quantity yielded 15 doughnuts which means you have to bake the doughnuts in two batches in order to use up all the batter.</li>
    <li>Bake the doughnuts in the oven for 15 minutes or until they feel firm and spring back when lightly touched.</li>
    <li>Allow the doughnuts to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a plate. Drizzle with chocolate when the doughnuts are almost cool to touch.</li>
  </ol>
